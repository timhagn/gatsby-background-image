**deprecation / refactor / fix / feat / doc:**
- `_depr` was added to classes generated by adding classId.
- `<BackgroundImage />` fixed & fluid branches were simplified to one return value.
- As the transitions still didn't work, a "micro fixed state machine (mFSM)" was 
integrated. Tests were refactored, mocks and setup moved to their own file.
- `isMounted` was removed in favor of setting `imageRef.onload` to `null` on 
`componentWillUnmount`.
- SSR tests were added. 
- Code Coverage was pushed to 100%.
- codecov was added to CircleCI build and badge added to README.
